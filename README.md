# Pandas
A Python Pandas dataframe is more than an array data structure. Pandas is a powerful tool that lets you: Convert JSON, CSV, array, dictionaries, and other data to row and column format     Work with them using names instead of indexes (you can still opt for indexes)  In short, Pandas is sort of like a spreadsheet, but one you work with using code, not Microsoft Excel. The biggest benefits:      Pandas makes extremely complicated data transformations easy and natural.     It includes a wealth of math, analytics, and other functions.
